# Project Description Document: Knowledge Base Management and Analysis Frontend Prototype

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

This project aims to build a frontend prototype to demonstrate and validate core functionalities of knowledge base management, semantic query, and report generation. With the explosive growth of information, enterprises and individuals have an increasingly urgent need for efficient management, intelligent retrieval, and deep analysis of knowledge. This prototype provides an intuitive interface to simplify the daily tasks of knowledge workers.

### 1.2 Target Users

The target users of this project include but are not limited to:

- **Knowledge Managers**: Responsible for knowledge content entry, classification, maintenance, and review.
- **Data Analysts**: Need to perform statistical analysis and trend insights on data in the knowledge base.
- **AI Application Developers**: Hope to quickly locate relevant knowledge content through semantic query functionality.
- **Content Consumers**: Efficiently obtain required information through intuitive interfaces and intelligent queries.

### 1.3 Product Vision

By providing a frontend solution that integrates content management, intelligent query, and data analysis, this product aims to help users more efficiently utilize their knowledge assets, improve decision-making efficiency, and ultimately drive business innovation.

## 2. User Stories and Scenario Descriptions

- **User Story 1: View Data Collection Overview**
  - **Scenario**: As a knowledge manager, I hope that when entering the system homepage, I can see the latest data collection situation at a glance (such as how much data RSS imported, how much data web scraping collected, success rate), as well as the total data volume in the knowledge base, to quickly understand the system operation status.
- **User Story 2: Manage Knowledge Content**
  - **Scenario**: As a knowledge manager, I need an interface to view, filter, delete, and modify content in the knowledge base. I hope to filter data by type or time, support single and batch deletion, and modify content metadata (such as tags, sources), even import new knowledge content through URLs, to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of the knowledge base.
- **User Story 3: Perform Semantic Query**
  - **Scenario**: As a researcher, I hope to input natural language query conditions, and the system can return knowledge content most semantically relevant to the query, sorted by matching probability, to quickly find required information, rather than relying on exact keyword matching.
- **User Story 4: Generate Data Analysis Reports**
  - **Scenario**: As a data analyst, I hope to generate clustering analysis reports of knowledge base data, such as clustering by content topics, sources, or tags, to discover potential patterns and trends in the knowledge base, assisting in decision analysis.
